### Description of presentation 1

In this meeting Lars (larshesel) and Thomas (tgk) present solutions to
code challenges comparing Erlang and Clojure. 

for now we are thinking of covering or talking about the following:

1. some basic stuff

2. everything is comparable

3. type system?

4. producer/consumer

5. lazy evaluation?

6. datagram parsing

7. pattern matching

8. datastructures

9. tail recursion

10. macros?

11. list comprehensions?

12. infinite lists

13. many processes

14. more stuff?

### Description of presentation 2

Agustin will present briefly about how erlang will be used to replace
the current backend of the location-based mobile game Gbanga.
