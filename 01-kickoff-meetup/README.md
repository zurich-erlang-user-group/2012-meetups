## KICKOFF MEETUP (09.05.2012)

### Short summary

Attending: 10 or 11 Erlangers.

In this meeting we did a presentation round - talked about our
backgrounds, what we would like to see in the Zurich Erlang User
Group, etc.

The biggest outcome of the meeting was probably a list of ideas for
talks/events/demos/projects that I've written down
[here](https://github.com/zurich-erlang-user-group/2012-meetups/blob/master/ideas-for-talks.md)

It was decided that the meetups should happen every first Wednesday of
the month. Therefore the next meetup is scheduled for the 6th of June.

Thomas and Lars announced they will do a talk at the next meetup
comparing solutions implemented in Clojure and Erlang.

Also Agustin will present briefly about how erlang will be used to replace the current
backend of the location-based mobile game Gbanga.
