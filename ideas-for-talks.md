## Ideas for talks

Below a list of ideas for topics/talks/demos/events we could do. I
wrote the name of the person who initially had the idea, so you know
who to contact if you would like more details on the subject.

* having a common project we can all contribute to - this should
  hopefully give us a read thread and continuity in the group, also if
  we don't have any talks planned - then we can always meet and
  work/hack/share what we did on our common project. (stefan)

  Stefan suggested a database browser that would work across many types of databases
  (stefan - correct me (or this text on github) if this is wrong)

* Hackathon: do bugfixing for eJabberd (muharem) 
  (Lars: or maybe some other project...)

* Building web applications with Erlang (muharem)

* [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) - a modern approach to Erlang (christoph)

* How to release/deploy an app with rebar (lars)

* Yecc and Leex - writing a simple lexer and grammar parser in Erlang
  (bikram)

* Configuration files for Erlang apps - best practices etc. (lars)

* Examples of good and bad code, how to structure programs (maybe for
  people who has an OOP background.) (lars)

* How to set up a kickass development environment (I'm using Emacs -
  and not totally happy about it yet - but ErlIde was just too weird)
  (lars)

* do parallel implementations in Erlang and some other language (for
  instance Clojure) (thomas). Muharem already has done similar work
  here:
    https://github.com/freizeit/exercises/tree/master/cj-a-store-credit
  He can do a talk on these experiments once the clojure code is ready.
